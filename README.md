<h1>Young Jamie, for everybody</h1>

<p>
If you enjoy watching podcast, chances are you have heard this name once. Jamie Vernon, or Young Jamie,
is the name of the producer of the Joe Rogan podcast. 
And if you enjoy watching podcasts, chances are that you like having long conversations with interesting
people too. 
So you sit down confortably with some of your friends and you start blabling around. The conversation
starts light and gets gradually more and more challenging (and exciting). Maybe it's because of the poison
(boozing and/or smoking) and/or maybe it's because of the challenging nature of the topic, but some points are
no longer clear and some facts are not longer certain, or even worse, forgotten. What happens then? Two options:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The conversation on this topic dies. A new topic is introduced or people head to bed.</li>
  <li>Facts are checked on the Internet.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The first option is appreciated by those who had no interest in the topic or were tired. Otherwise, no one really want's that.
The second option is the right approach if you want a purposeful conversation is the goal. However, there is a big problem with 
the this option, and it's that searching for too long will inevitably loose some people because of boredom. 
Nowadays more than ever, we get bored and distracted very fast. If we want the conversation on a specific topic to last, we need
to keep talking and engaging with our conversation buddies. Taking a pause to look something up on the internet loose the audience
and can be akward in some situation.

<h4>So why Young Jamie? And what do I want to get to with this?</h4>
<p>
Well, Young Jamie produces for Joe Rogan's podcast, but what he also does is act as an assistant to Joe Rogan and his guests. 
You might have seen that whenever Joe has some doubt about some things, or when he wants to bring visual support to what he 
is saying, he simply asks Young Jamie to search it up for him. That way, the conversation never stops and subject are dug all
the way to their roots. 
</p>
<p>
Thus, YoungJamie is an application that does exactly that. Leveraging voice recognition, intelligent searching and displayed on a easy 
to use interface, it brings forward information about the current conversation topic in real time. That way the conversation flows, and
when help is needed, all the information is right there at your fingertips.
